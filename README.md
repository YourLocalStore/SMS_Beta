# Welcome to the Student Management System (SMS)!
Kept together with zip ties and duct tape, this is a simple, easy-to-use management system that is mainly housed on MySQL to fetch and send data. You can think of it as some sort of "simulator" for a traditional LMS, just simpler!
Some of the features include:

- A Login and Register System
- Adding and Removing Students
- Viewing Student Information
- Viewing Account Information

# Built With
This is a list of libraries and modules that were used throughout this project:
- MySQL, for database features;
- PTable, for formatting tables;
- Datetime & Time, for time-related outputs (or to delay some functions);
- Threading, for some things to load simultaneously

# How does it Work?

It's a console-based program, so no TKinter or GUI-based programs were involved in the making, except for some formatting libraries like PTable.

First, you need to register an account. This is really just a school project, you can enter anything you want as a field and it will accept it! 
You can choose between three different types of users:
- Student, which can view and manage account information and look at classrooms they are in.
- Teacher, which can view and manage student within the classroom, as well as their own information.
- Administrator, highest level of permissions, can do anything from managing all classrooms to removing teachers/students.

Once you make your "account", you will be given sets of options depending on what you choose. There should be a "help" option across all accounts once
you login which tells you what each option does. 

# Getting Started
